# My LeetCode
My solutions to LeetCode Problems.

These are my solutions to LeetCode problems. I will try to solve as many problems as possible and keep updating this repository.
All the solutions in `/solutions` are written by me with co-pilot off and are not copied from any other source.
Solutions in `/other` have not been solved by me, I have only rewritten the solution for educational purposes.

Tests have been written with the help of co-pilot.

There is a script `leetcode.py` that can be used to create a new problem file with the problem description and test cases.
